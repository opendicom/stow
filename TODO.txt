NOT TO DO: (be careful): Received dicom files should not be editable.

Move to latest dcmtk used through dcmtk-objc (should be a dependency and the files should not be copied to storestow target)

Create a stow URLsession routine

Replace J2KR or ELE save to file by write to output stream in URLsession

Improve checking of stow results

Optionally consume MWL through findscu+dcmtk-objc and based on it and on a diccionary with rules, coerce the metadata on the fly.
